1. Stated with project
* Fixed project structure
2. created a DEV directory - aka working directory. added in .gitignore. if do it again, include it for commits.

Problem: 
1. The recieved data was bad. XML were badly structured. Got to re-do with copy paste to get a valid and workable json-object.
2. Misinterpreted submission, thought it was the controlstring that was the instegator for the textbox to be cleared.

Choose to work with json since that's the most common type used today. 
Could normalize it a bit more. But uncertain about the readability.
