1. Stated with project
2. created a DEV directory - aka working directory. added in .gitignore. if do it again, include it for commits.

Problem: 
1. The recieved data was bad. XML were badly structured. Got to re-do with copy paste to get a valid and workable json-object.

Choose to work with json since that's the most common type used today.
